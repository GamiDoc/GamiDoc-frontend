        This component is dedicated to the definition of the main modality
        included in the gamification software. Despite the scarcity of evidence
        on cooperative gamification, the few results in literature show
        differences in cooperative and competitive modalities of gamification
        and that different game elements support the different modalities. In
        the identification of different gamification modalities, we decided to
        follow the distinction made by Morschheuser and colleagues between (1)
        individual, (2) cooperative, (3) competitive, and (4)
        cooperative-competitive gamification features, with the last one
        referring to those elements which support usersâ€™ cooperation with their
        ingroup (i.e., team mates), and competition with the outgroup (i.e.,
        team competition).
